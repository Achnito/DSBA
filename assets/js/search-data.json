            "content": ". Executive Summary . This section elaborates on the relevance of our analysis and methods utilized in this paper for business-decision purposes. . The main purpose with this paper is to allow a chosen category of businesses, in a specific area, to filter relevant reviews and based on this, make better-informed choices. In this paper we discover the most popular categories and cities that have been reviewed. Based on that, we chose to delve into Phoenix with relatively high demand(reviews) and low market saturation. We conduct a thorough sentiment analysis on the negative and positive reviews, which allows the businesses to grasp an understanding of what their customers are satisfied and dissatisfied about. This entails a comprehension of what facets to improve in the various nightlife entities. By also identifying the customers that tend to be extremely positive and negative, we aim to exclude the reviews that tend to be too extreme in order to reduce the biases in our project. Specifically, when analysing the nightlife in Phoenix, we figure out the most popular nightlife categories, which draws a picture of what new entrants should consider opening in order to increase the success rate at launch. ((((Write about topic modeling)))) . . Introduction to the Data . In this project, we have chosen to work with an open dataset provided by Yelp (you can download and read more about the data set here). . Yelp is an online review platform that enables people to find user recommendations of a wide range of businesses - and write reviews of their own experiences. To give a review as user is asked to give a star rating on a scale from 1 to 5 and include a description of the experience the user had with the entity. . This dataset was made available for use in personal, educational and academic purposes. It is a subset consisting of reviews, businesses and users across 10 metropolitan areas. More specifically, it contains data on more than 8 million reviews, two-hundred-thousand businesses, and almost 2 million users. The dataset is downloaded as a compressed tar-file format. Uncompressed there are 5 json-files and a total of 9.8GB data - a rather huge dataset. . On a Data Science stand point this dataset is rather interesting as it contains a vast amount of data, including structured and unstructured data (text). For the more demanding project, Yelp has made an additional dataset available containing 200.000 photos that has been posted on their platform in connection with the reviews. These photos however, are not included in this project. . Problem Statement . After a thorough inspection of the documentation, we decided to use three main data sets: Business.json, review.json and user.json. Thus, check-ins and tips (shorter reviews) has been excluded from the analysis. . We found these datasets to be interesting for our project as they contain text reviews and additional related data about the users that has writes the reviews and the businesses that reviewed. This allows us to extract features of the data to gain important and actionable insights about the businesses and the markets they operate in. . Inspired by House of Cards (How Netflix Used Data Science to Create One of the Most Loved Shows Ever: House of Cards) we came up with an interesting subject for analysis - our problem statement: . Question for Analysis . What are the features that seperates the best and worst performing businesses - and how can we use these insights to create a successful new business concept? . Description of the Datasets . A description of the dataset is listed in the documentation. Here, we provide you with a simplified description of the datasets: . Business.json . Contains bussiness data including location data, attributes and categories: . business_id: ID of the business | name: name of the business | address: address of the business | city: city of the business | state: state of the business | postal_code: postal code of the business | latitude: latitude of the business | longitude: longitude of the business | stars: average rating of the business | review_count: number of reviews received | is_open: 1 if the business is open, 0 if the business has closed down | attributes: | categories: multiple categories of the business | hours: business opening hours | . Review.json . Contains full review text data including the user_id that wrote the review and the business_id the review was written for: . review_id: ID of the review | user_id: ID of the user | business_id: ID of the business | stars: stars given in review | date: time of review | text: the review | useful: number of people that found the review useful | funny: number of people that found the review funny | cool: number of people that found the review cool | . User.json . Contains user data including the user&#39;s friend mapping and all the metadata associated with the user. . user_id: ID of the review | name: name of the user | review_count: number of reviews given | yelping_since: user creation date | friends: the user’s friends as an array of user_ids | useful: number of useful vores sent by the user | funny: number of funny vores sent by the user | cool: number of cool vores sent by the user | fans: number of fans the user has | elite: years the user had elite status as an array. | average_stars: average star rating given by the user | compliments: number of times the user was complimented. | . Methodology . Steps of Analysis . To anwer the question of interest, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain an understanding of the business context and which factors that has proven a business successful or not. Here, we will investigate what business categories that the users are mostly interested in and where the demand is located. Furthermore, we explore which businesses that has been successful in attracting customers to their business and how well they succeed in satisfying the consumers&#39; needs. Finally, for the data exploration, we investigate the correlation between customer satisfaction and whether the business is still in business or not. . From the EDA a few businesses of interest will be further investigated by applying Topic Modeling to understand what features in the reviews that set the best performing businesses apart from the lowest performing businesses. These insights can help future businesses to design a better business model and to know what the customers&#39; main success criteria and complaints are. . Moreover, we will apply a supervised machine learning model on top of the topic modeling to enable businesses to predict the outcome of different narratives. This will enable businesses to delve deeper into their business design and make decision on what features they should include in order to provide the best possible customer experience. I other words, this model enables business to design their business on the narratives they would like the customers to experience - a very powerful tool. . Preprocessing Steps . To prepare our data for analysis we will start by delimitting the data to represent a business category and location of interest. We do this as we assume that customer demand may wary across different locations and categories. . Moving on, we will look at the users and identify those that tend to be too negative or positive in their reviews. This is an important step, as some users might be “notorious complainers” and thus might skew the results. . Similarly, the number of reviews assigned to a business is an important aspect to consider - the less amount of data the less representative. These businesses will therefore present unreliable results. In order to avoid this problem, we will filter out businesses that fail to exceed a number of reviews assigned to them. . Limitation: . We only read in 1,000,000 lines of data from the review.json as well as from the user.json. Those 2 data sets were rather large, and our computers lacked the necessary memory to work with them. What this means is that we “lost” some information, however we thought that this would not interfere with our ability to demonstrate our proficiency of the newly acquired methods and tools. (Data preprocessing, EDA, Topic Modeling, SML, etc.) Eventually, our “final” data set (phoenix_nightlife.csv) reached a size of 1 GB, thus we had plenty of data to work with. . . Preprocessing . Installation &amp; Libraries . As usual, before we can initialize the preprocessing steps, we will need a repository of libraries to work with the data. . We have provided you with interactive buttons throughout this page, that you can use to display or hide certain code cells of your interest. As such, we have provided you with a list of the installations and libraries below. . We wish you happy reading! . #Installations !pip install wordcloud #Imports import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline from wordcloud import WordCloud from sklearn import metrics from sklearn import decomposition from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer import sklearn.utils as utils from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB import joblib as joblib from google.colab import files #Use to upload single files from local directory from google.colab import drive #Use to mount google drive to access documents saved in the cloud . . . Note: Not all code cells are displayed in this page. For the full notebook, please refer to the GitHub, Binder or Colab as listed in the top of this page. . Delimiting the dataset . To efficiently work with the data, we have created a google drive folder and mounted it to Colab. We have filled the drive with all the relevant json-files and will also be used to host future data sets that are created throughout this project. You can view the Drive here. . In this section we will delimit the area of research to a specific business category and area of interest. This allows us to dig deeper into the data and compare businesses that operate within the same space. . We will start by identifying which business categories that are the most popular. Later, we will look at the businesses locations to identify which location is the most interesting for a new business to enter. Here, popularity is defined as the number of businesses that are working within the same category, while the most interesting locations are defined as those with the highest demand compared to the current supply (the locations with the lowest market saturation). It is assumed that the barrier of entry for any given business is lowest when the market saturation is similarly low. Thus, this provides a great indicator of where to invest in a new business. . Delimit by Business Category . Let&#39;s start by looking at the business.json data: . business_json_path = &#39;/content/drive/MyDrive/DSBA_Project/yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json&#39; business = pd.read_json(business_json_path, lines=True) business.head() . . business_id name address city state postal_code latitude longitude stars review_count is_open attributes categories hours . 0 f9NumwFMBDn751xgFiRbNA | The Range At Lake Norman | 10913 Bailey Rd | Cornelius | NC | 28031 | 35.462724 | -80.852612 | 3.5 | 36 | 1 | {&#39;BusinessAcceptsCreditCards&#39;: &#39;True&#39;, &#39;BikePa... | Active Life, Gun/Rifle Ranges, Guns &amp; Ammo, Sh... | {&#39;Monday&#39;: &#39;10:0-18:0&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;: &#39;11:0-20:0&#39;... | . 1 Yzvjg0SayhoZgCljUJRF9Q | Carlos Santo, NMD | 8880 E Via Linda, Ste 107 | Scottsdale | AZ | 85258 | 33.569404 | -111.890264 | 5.0 | 4 | 1 | {&#39;GoodForKids&#39;: &#39;True&#39;, &#39;ByAppointmentOnly&#39;: &#39;... | Health &amp; Medical, Fitness &amp; Instruction, Yoga,... | None | . 2 XNoUzKckATkOD1hP6vghZg | Felinus | 3554 Rue Notre-Dame O | Montreal | QC | H4C 1P4 | 45.479984 | -73.580070 | 5.0 | 5 | 1 | None | Pets, Pet Services, Pet Groomers | None | . 3 6OAZjbxqM5ol29BuHsil3w | Nevada House of Hose | 1015 Sharp Cir | North Las Vegas | NV | 89030 | 36.219728 | -115.127725 | 2.5 | 3 | 0 | {&#39;BusinessAcceptsCreditCards&#39;: &#39;True&#39;, &#39;ByAppo... | Hardware Stores, Home Services, Building Suppl... | {&#39;Monday&#39;: &#39;7:0-16:0&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;: &#39;7:0-16:0&#39;, ... | . 4 51M2Kk903DFYI6gnB5I6SQ | USE MY GUY SERVICES LLC | 4827 E Downing Cir | Mesa | AZ | 85205 | 33.428065 | -111.726648 | 4.5 | 26 | 1 | {&#39;BusinessAcceptsCreditCards&#39;: &#39;True&#39;, &#39;ByAppo... | Home Services, Plumbing, Electricians, Handyma... | {&#39;Monday&#39;: &#39;0:0-0:0&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;: &#39;9:0-16:0&#39;, &#39;... | . From the data we see that the each business are assigned to multiple categories. For instance, Felinus is working within three different categories: &#39;pets, pet services and pet groomers&#39;. . To identify the most popular category each business is split into multiple rows, each containing just one single category. Thus, Felinus will be split into 3 rows. Finally, each category is counted to display the ones that are appearing most often within the business data: . It is important to note that some businesses have closed down and are no longer in operation. We might not want to include these when trying to find the most popular business categories. . . Note: adress, latitude, longitude and hours has been excluded. . business_open = business[business.is_open == 1] #Filter out business that has closed business_explode = business_open.assign(categories = business_open.categories.str.split(&#39;, &#39;)).explode(&#39;categories&#39;) #Split categories into multiple rows business_popular_cat = business_explode.categories.value_counts() #Count number of times a category appears in the data business_popular_cat = pd.DataFrame(business_popular_cat) #Visualization of the 20 most popular business categories plt.figure(figsize= (25, 15)) plt.style.use(&#39;ggplot&#39;) sns.barplot(business_popular_cat.categories[:20], business_popular_cat.index[:20]) plt.title(&#39;Top 20 categories of businesses&#39;, fontdict= {&#39;fontsize&#39;: 24}) plt.xlabel(&#39;Number of businesses&#39;, fontdict= {&#39;fontsize&#39;: 18}) plt.tick_params(labelsize= 16) plt.savefig(&#39;categories_top_20.png&#39;) . . /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/seaborn/_decorators.py:43: FutureWarning: Pass the following variables as keyword args: x, y. From version 0.12, the only valid positional argument will be `data`, and passing other arguments without an explicit keyword will result in an error or misinterpretation. FutureWarning . Chosen Category of Interest . As seen by the barplot, more than 40.000 restaurants are listed on Yelp&#39;s platform, making restaurants by far the most popular business category.This could be a clear indication of a business category with fierce competition but could also prove a great place of analysis, as this business segment might need a thorough understanding of the customers&#39; needs in order to successfully position itself in the market, more than any other business. . Even so, we delimit our analysis on the 9th most commonly listed category on Yelp: the Nightlife category. We found this category particularly interesting to analyse as we believe nightlife is a very complex business area where the lines that defines a successful business are quite blurred and washed out. Our hopes are, that we through our analysis can gain a better understanding of, which features that are important for customers to give them a great experience and help new businesses in creating successful business concepts. . Delimit by Location . business_nightlife = business[business[&#39;categories&#39;].str.contains(&#39;Nightlife&#39;, case= False, na= False)] . .

In order to make our analysis more valid, we only want to consider businesses with above 1000 reviews for assessing the top rated businesses. It is very likely that a businesses with 5 stars rating and the highest amount of reviews are favoured by more visitors compared to a business with 5 star rating and relatively low amount of review counts. . Likewise, when assessing the worst performing businesses, we only want to consider the businesses with above 100 review counts. These businesses are constantly getting bad ratings compared to businesses with bad ratings, however, also low review counts. . By filtering out in such a way, we are able to select the businesses that are constantly performing at the higest and lowest level, which will give the foundation for building the perfect business concept in Phoenix. . star_rating_skimmed = star_rating[star_rating.review_count &gt;= 1000] star_rating_skimmed . business_id name city review_count stars . 0 Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ | Little Miss BBQ | Phoenix | 2329 | 5.0 | . 121 VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ | Bobby Q | Phoenix | 3302 | 4.5 | . 122 S-oLPRdhlyL5HAknBKTUcQ | Harumi Sushi | Phoenix | 1342 | 4.5 | . 123 u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg | Postino Arcadia | Phoenix | 1307 | 4.5 | . 124 ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ | The Clever Koi | Phoenix | 1221 | 4.5 | . 125 ukCTLs6T8LY1eUBXiAlmCg | Steak 44 | Phoenix | 1201 | 4.5 | . 126 FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA | Postino Central | Phoenix | 1137 | 4.5 | . 127 cTZmf7B-4yciMc1WKiCVOA | Welcome Diner | Phoenix | 1073 | 4.5 | . 430 yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ | The Arrogant Butcher | Phoenix | 2358 | 4.0 | . 431 OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg | Lux Central | Phoenix | 2210 | 4.0 | . 432 frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A | La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop | Phoenix | 2152 | 4.0 | . 433 3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ | Taco Guild | Phoenix | 1887 | 4.0 | . 434 J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ | Hula&#39;s Modern Tiki | Phoenix | 1235 | 4.0 | . 435 cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw | Windsor | Phoenix | 1207 | 4.0 | . 436 Gz9SlLqxS6wnxPvgdOQNrA | Bitter &amp; Twisted Cocktail Parlour | Phoenix | 1180 | 4.0 | . 437 plWuv4gda7m0KlqCNhrb4w | Angels Trumpet Ale House | Phoenix | 1168 | 4.0 | . 438 fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg | Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe | Phoenix | 1136 | 4.0 | . 439 NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g | Delux | Phoenix | 1066 | 4.0 | . 440 LHyj66waFlDcw9UToo27JQ | Angry Crab Shack | Phoenix | 1028 | 4.0 | . 441 PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg | FEZ | Phoenix | 1028 | 4.0 | . sns.barplot(star_rating_skimmed.review_count[:20], star_rating_skimmed.name[:20], ci=None, hue=star_rating_skimmed.stars[:20]); plt.title(&#39;Top 20 nightlife businesses in Phoenix&#39;) plt.xscale(&#39;log&#39;) . /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/seaborn/_decorators.py:43: FutureWarning: Pass the following variables as keyword args: x, y.

We can conclude from the above two barplots that &#39;Little Miss BBQ&#39; has a significant review count, and still maintains to keep an average star rate at 5. On the contrary, one of the lowest performing entities which is interesting to look at is &#39;Hooters&#39; with a review count above 200, but remains as the worst performing business. These two companies will be used as case studies in the review insights chapter. . In the tabular tablefor worst performing businesses, Applebee&#39;s Grill + Bar shows up multiple times and these represent multiple entities in Phoenix, as these all have different business IDs. . .

From the above table, we can conclude that &#39;Restaurants&#39; is the most popular business concept that has been reviewed, specifically American (new) themed restaurants. Secondly, bars score highly, specifically cocktail bars are popular in Phoenix. . Assessing if experience has a significant effect on whether or not a business stays open . So how important are reviews for a business in Phoenix? Does it define whether a business will remain open or not? With these questions in mind, we want to test the probability that a business is closed based on experience . phoenix_weight.is_open.value_counts(normalize= True) . 1 0.867187 0 0.132813 Name: is_open, dtype: float64 . pd.crosstab(phoenix_weight.is_open, phoenix_weight.experience, normalize= True) . experience 0 1 . is_open . 0 0.045571 | 0.087242 | . 1 0.246586 | 0.620601 | . We want to compute a simple cross tabulation of the two factors, If a business is open and the overall experience. The return is a frequency table and here we can see that there is a significant proportion of positive experience for the businesses that closed down, compared to the negative experiences. Thus, there is a no correlation between the experience and whether the business stays open or not. . Review Insights . Positive experience .

Summary of topic modeling . The outcome of the topic modeling corresponds to our intuition, that businesses would get bad reviewsif their staff was rude, the service took ages and the quality of the product was sub-optimal. Words, such as &quot;horrible&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;rude&quot; were found among the 1 star reviews, indicating, that potentially the staff was rude, as well as their overall experience was bad. The 2 star reviews contained words such as &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;hour&quot; which allows us to assume that the businesses were down-rated because of the speed of their service. Reviews from the 4, 5 star ranges seemed to highlight the fact, that the stuff was rather friendly, the product was fresh and good quality and the service was fast. The above described tendency was found in the positive vs negative experience topic modeling too. . As the business called &quot;Little Miss BBQ&quot; was the best performing business in Phoenix, we looked into their reviews to see what could cause their success. The outcome seems to be that their service is rather friendly and their food (especially their meat products) are praised for their tastiness. In order to get a more concrete view on what makes a business a &quot;worst performing one&quot;, we looked into &quot;Hooters&quot; as their rating is 2 and a large number of reviews agree on the aforementioned star value. Their rating potentially can be explained by slow service and bad enough food. . Supervised Machine Learning . In this section, we create a classifier that predicts the experience of the reviewer. .

RandomizedSearchCV . This is a method to search through the space of different combinations of hyper-parameters. We used the randomized method to decrease the amount of computation needed. Instead, we could hve used GridSearchCV, however, we would have had to search through 288 (6 4 6 * 2) parameter combination.

Summary of Supervised Machine Learning . We used the combination of pipelines and randomized search CV. According to our studies, this is a really powerful way to develop proficient models. Moreover, we decided to create a test set, that was only used for validation (not even used in grid search) in order to get the most unbiased estimate of accuracy. We used CountVectorizer to represent text numerically, as MultinomialNB may have problems working with non-integer values. We imagined that this model could be useful for businesses to keep track of the customers who provide a bad review and potentially, the business can follow up with that customer to improve their experience and as a consequence increase the busnibusiness&#39;s overall rating. An evaluation criterion for this specific use-case that should be as high as possible is the specifity, thus the business could reach out to the highest number of customers who had a potentially negative experience. .",

            "content": ". Executive Summary . This section elaborates on the relevance of our analysis and methods utilized in this paper for business-decision purposes. . The main purpose with this paper is to allow a chosen category of businesses, in a specific area, to filter relevant reviews and based on this, make better-informed choices. In this paper we discover the most popular categories and cities that have been reviewed. Based on that, we chose to delve into Phoenix with relatively high demand(reviews) and low market saturation. We conduct a thorough sentiment analysis on the negative and positive reviews, which allows the businesses to grasp an understanding of what their customers are satisfied and dissatisfied about. This entails a comprehension of what facets to improve in the various nightlife entities. By also identifying the customers that tend to be extremely positive and negative, we aim to exclude the reviews that tend to be too extreme in order to reduce the biases in our project. Specifically, when analysing the nightlife in Phoenix, we figure out the most popular nightlife categories, which draws a picture of what new entrants should consider opening in order to increase the success rate at launch. ((((Write about topic modeling)))) . . Introduction to the Data . In this project, we have chosen to work with an open dataset provided by Yelp (you can download and read more about the data set here). . Yelp is an online review platform that enables people to find user recommendations of a wide range of businesses - and write reviews of their own experiences. To give a review as user is asked to give a star rating on a scale from 1 to 5 and include a description of the experience the user had with the entity. . This dataset was made available for use in personal, educational and academic purposes. It is a subset consisting of reviews, businesses and users across 10 metropolitan areas. More specifically, it contains data on more than 8 million reviews, two-hundred-thousand businesses, and almost 2 million users. The dataset is downloaded as a compressed tar-file format. Uncompressed there are 5 json-files and a total of 9.8GB data - a rather huge dataset. . On a Data Science stand point this dataset is rather interesting as it contains a vast amount of data, including structured and unstructured data (text). For the more demanding project, Yelp has made an additional dataset available containing 200.000 photos that has been posted on their platform in connection with the reviews. These photos however, are not included in this project. . Problem Statement . After a thorough inspection of the documentation, we decided to use three main data sets: Business.json, review.json and user.json. Thus, check-ins and tips (shorter reviews) has been excluded from the analysis. . We found these datasets to be interesting for our project as they contain text reviews and additional related data about the users that has writes the reviews and the businesses that reviewed. This allows us to extract features of the data to gain important and actionable insights about the businesses and the markets they operate in. . Inspired by House of Cards (How Netflix Used Data Science to Create One of the Most Loved Shows Ever: House of Cards) we came up with an interesting subject for analysis - our problem statement: . Question for Analysis . What are the features that seperates the best and worst performing businesses - and how can we use these insights to create a successful new business concept? . Description of the Datasets . A description of the dataset is listed in the documentation. Here, we provide you with a simplified description of the datasets: . Business.json . Contains bussiness data including location data, attributes and categories: . business_id: ID of the business | name: name of the business | address: address of the business | city: city of the business | state: state of the business | postal_code: postal code of the business | latitude: latitude of the business | longitude: longitude of the business | stars: average rating of the business | review_count: number of reviews received | is_open: 1 if the business is open, 0 if the business has closed down | attributes: | categories: multiple categories of the business | hours: business opening hours | . Review.json . Contains full review text data including the user_id that wrote the review and the business_id the review was written for: . review_id: ID of the review | user_id: ID of the user | business_id: ID of the business | stars: stars given in review | date: time of review | text: the review | useful: number of people that found the review useful | funny: number of people that found the review funny | cool: number of people that found the review cool | . User.json . Contains user data including the user&#39;s friend mapping and all the metadata associated with the user. . user_id: ID of the review | name: name of the user | review_count: number of reviews given | yelping_since: user creation date | friends: the user’s friends as an array of user_ids | useful: number of useful vores sent by the user | funny: number of funny vores sent by the user | cool: number of cool vores sent by the user | fans: number of fans the user has | elite: years the user had elite status as an array. | average_stars: average star rating given by the user | compliments: number of times the user was complimented. | . Methodology . Steps of Analysis . To anwer the question of interest, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain an understanding of the business context and which factors that has proven a business successful or not. Here, we will investigate what business categories that the users are mostly interested in and where the demand is located. Furthermore, we explore which businesses that has been successful in attracting customers to their business and how well they succeed in satisfying the consumers&#39; needs. Finally, for the data exploration, we investigate the correlation between customer satisfaction and whether the business is still in business or not. . From the EDA a few businesses of interest will be further investigated by applying Topic Modeling to understand what features in the reviews that set the best performing businesses apart from the lowest performing businesses. These insights can help future businesses to design a better business model and to know what the customers&#39; main success criteria and complaints are. . Moreover, we will apply a supervised machine learning model on top of the topic modeling to enable businesses to predict the outcome of different narratives. This will enable businesses to delve deeper into their business design and make decision on what features they should include in order to provide the best possible customer experience. I other words, this model enables business to design their business on the narratives they would like the customers to experience - a very powerful tool. . Preprocessing Steps . To prepare our data for analysis we will start by delimitting the data to represent a business category and location of interest. We do this as we assume that customer demand may wary across different locations and categories. . Moving on, we will look at the users and identify those that tend to be too negative or positive in their reviews. This is an important step, as some users might be “notorious complainers” and thus might skew the results. . Similarly, the number of reviews assigned to a business is an important aspect to consider - the less amount of data the less representative. These businesses will therefore present unreliable results. In order to avoid this problem, we will filter out businesses that fail to exceed a number of reviews assigned to them. . Limitation: . We only read in 1,000,000 lines of data from the review.json as well as from the user.json. Those 2 data sets were rather large, and our computers lacked the necessary memory to work with them. What this means is that we “lost” some information, however we thought that this would not interfere with our ability to demonstrate our proficiency of the newly acquired methods and tools. (Data preprocessing, EDA, Topic Modeling, SML, etc.) Eventually, our “final” data set (csv) reached a size of 1 GB, thus we had plenty of data to work with. .

In the above table, we get an overview of the higest and lowest rated businesses and their resepctive review counts. In order to make our analysis more valid, we only want to consider businesses with above 1000 reviews for assessing the top rated businesses. It is very likely that a businesses with 5 stars rating and the highest amount of reviews are favoured by more visitors compared to a business with 5 star rating and relatively low amount of review counts. . Likewise, when assessing the worst performing businesses, we only want to consider the businesses with above 100 review counts. These businesses are constantly getting bad ratings compared to businesses with bad ratings, however, also low review counts. . By filtering out in such a way, we are able to select the businesses that are constantly performing at the higest and lowest level, which will give the foundation for building the perfect business concept in Phoenix. . star_rating_skimmed = star_rating[star_rating.review_count &gt;= 1000] star_rating_skimmed . business_id name city review_count stars . 0 Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ | Little Miss BBQ | Phoenix | 2329 | 5.0 | . 121 VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ | Bobby Q | Phoenix | 3302 | 4.5 | . 122 S-oLPRdhlyL5HAknBKTUcQ | Harumi Sushi | Phoenix | 1342 | 4.5 | . 123 u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg | Postino Arcadia | Phoenix | 1307 | 4.5 | . 124 ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ | The Clever Koi | Phoenix | 1221 | 4.5 | . 125 ukCTLs6T8LY1eUBXiAlmCg | Steak 44 | Phoenix | 1201 | 4.5 | . 126 FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA | Postino Central | Phoenix | 1137 | 4.5 | . 127 cTZmf7B-4yciMc1WKiCVOA | Welcome Diner | Phoenix | 1073 | 4.5 | . 430 yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ | The Arrogant Butcher | Phoenix | 2358 | 4.0 | . 431 OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg | Lux Central | Phoenix | 2210 | 4.0 | . 432 frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A | La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop | Phoenix | 2152 | 4.0 | . 433 3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ | Taco Guild | Phoenix | 1887 | 4.0 | . 434 J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ | Hula&#39;s Modern Tiki | Phoenix | 1235 | 4.0 | . 435 cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw | Windsor | Phoenix | 1207 | 4.0 | . 436 Gz9SlLqxS6wnxPvgdOQNrA | Bitter &amp; Twisted Cocktail Parlour | Phoenix | 1180 | 4.0 | . 437 plWuv4gda7m0KlqCNhrb4w | Angels Trumpet Ale House | Phoenix | 1168 | 4.0 | . 438 fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg | Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe | Phoenix | 1136 | 4.0 | . 439 NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g | Delux | Phoenix | 1066 | 4.0 | . 440 LHyj66waFlDcw9UToo27JQ | Angry Crab Shack | Phoenix | 1028 | 4.0 | . 441 PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg | FEZ | Phoenix | 1028 | 4.0 | . sns.barplot(star_rating_skimmed.review_count[:20], star_rating_skimmed.name[:20], ci=None, hue=star_rating_skimmed.stars[:20]); plt.title(&#39;Top 20 nightlife businesses in Phoenix&#39;) plt.xscale(&#39;log&#39;) . /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/seaborn/_decorators.py:43: FutureWarning: Pass the following variables as keyword args: x, y.

Secondly, bars score highly, specifically cocktail bars are popular in Phoenix. . Assessing if experience has a significant effect on whether or not a business stays open . So how important are reviews for a business in Phoenix? Does it define whether a business will remain open or not? With these questions in mind, we want to test the probability that a business is closed based on experience . phoenix_weight.is_open.value_counts(normalize= True) . 1 0.867187 0 0.132813 Name: is_open, dtype: float64 . pd.crosstab(phoenix_weight.is_open, phoenix_weight.experience, normalize= True) . experience 0 1 . is_open . 0 0.045571 | 0.087242 | . 1 0.246586 | 0.620601 | . We want to compute a simple cross tabulation of the two factors, If a business is open and the overall experience. The return is a frequency table and here we can see that there is a significant proportion of positive experience for the businesses that closed down, compared to the negative experiences. Thus, there is a no correlation between the experience and whether the business stays open or not. . Review Insights . Positive experience .

Summary of topic modeling . The outcome of the topic modeling corresponds to our intuition, that businesses would get bad reviewsif their staff was rude, the service took ages and the quality of the product was sub-optimal. Words, such as &quot;horrible&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;rude&quot; were found among the 1 star reviews, indicating, that potentially the staff was rude, as well as their overall experience was bad. The 2 star reviews contained words such as &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;hour&quot; which allows us to assume that the businesses were down-rated because of the speed of their service. Reviews from the 4, 5 star ranges seemed to highlight the fact, that the stuff was rather friendly, the product was fresh and good quality and the service was fast. The above described tendency was found in the positive vs negative experience topic modeling too. . As the business called &quot;Little Miss BBQ&quot; was the best performing business in Phoenix, we looked into their reviews to see what could cause their success. The outcome seems to be that their service is rather friendly and their food (especially their meat products) are praised for their tastiness. In order to get a more concrete view on what makes a business a &quot;worst performing one&quot;, we looked into &quot;Hooters&quot; as their rating is 2 and a large number of reviews agree on the aforementioned star value. Their rating potentially can be explained by slow service and bad enough food. . Supervised Machine Learning . In this section, we create a classifier that predicts the experience of the reviewer. .

RandomizedSearchCV . This is a method to search through the space of different combinations of hyper-parameters. We used the randomized method to decrease the amount of computation needed.

Summary of Supervised Machine Learning . We used the combination of pipelines and randomized search CV. According to our studies, this is a really powerful way to develop proficient models. Moreover, we decided to create a test set, that was only used for validation (not even used in grid search) in order to get the most unbiased estimate of accuracy. We used CountVectorizer to represent text numerically, as MultinomialNB may have problems working with non-integer values. We imagined that this model could be useful for businesses to keep track of the customers who provide a bad review and potentially, the business can follow up with that customer to improve their experience and as a consequence increase the busnibusiness&#39;s overall rating. An evaluation criterion for this specific use-case that should be as high as possible is the specifity, thus the business could reach out to the highest number of customers who had a potentially negative experience. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
